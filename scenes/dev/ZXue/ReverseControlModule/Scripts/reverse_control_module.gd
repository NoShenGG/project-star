'''REVERSE CONTROL - Reverses user control. contributed by Zifeng Xue.
Add this node to the main node tree to make it work.
Reverses movement controls, does not change anything else.
Provides a boolean variable that may be used as the switch for this.
Also provides an integrated timer that works as the time limit for reversing input,
which should come in handy when you want to set this as a debuff for a certain time period.

See the descriptions of the methods for specific information.

	This if-statement is for avoiding a certain glitch that occured during test.
	After switching back to normal input, it appears that reverseOn() is still called every reverseTime seconds.
	This is because the the timer is not stopped and still sends the signal of it stopping every reverseTime seconds.
